## Installation
- Clone the `main` branch of this repository to your machine
- Download the latest release from the [Godot Asset Lib](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset)
- Add the `submodule` branch as [Git Submodule](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-submodule) to your own repo
  - The `submodule` branch is **always** up to date with `main` and will allow you to consistently use the newest version by `pulling`
  - If you are not confident in your CL skills, you can use a client like GitKraken to set this up



## Usage
Make sure the clones the `addons` and `script_templates` directories into your project.

1. Add a `FiniteStateMachine` or `BTRoot` node to your scene.
2. A toolbox will appear in the editor, allowing you to add behaviour nodes to the scene.
3. Setup and configure your behaviour nodes in the inspector.
4. Right-click your `FSMState`/`FSMTransition`/`BTLeaf` and extend the script.

Now you can implement your own behaviour logic using the virtual methods provided by the script templates.

## Notes 
This is the first time I've ever made a bigger plugin for Godot, so I am happy for any suggestions, feedback and contributions. If you need help or have any questions, feel free to contact me on Discord (`thepat02`) or open an issue on GitHub!

You can also [buy me a coffee](https://ko-fi.com/pat02) if you like the plugin and feel like supporting me :D

Have fun creating awesome behaviours!
